1. I had a folder on my desktop which contained all of my data. I then pushed this to github. I didn't create a new folder, just because I might as well have them all on there. 

2. In terminal, I did the following commands:

cd Desktop/
git init Ph\ 20
cd Ph\ 20
git pull
cd Assn3

3-5. I opened up the file ph-20-3-1.py and added a very useful comment. I then went to terminal and did:

cd ../
git push
git add -A
git commit -m "Some message that I forget"
