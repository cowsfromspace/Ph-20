# Lissajous Curves

# Problem 5

My primary programming experiences have been in Python (CS1) and Java (High School CS).
I enjoy the Python language, especially how similar to pseudocode it often is. I had 
some experience with these specific modules, but not extensively, so it was interesting
to implement them again. I enjoyed being able to create an open-ended implementation related
to a problem.

Guido van Rossum's argument that people fall in love with Python because of its simplicity
is absolutely my feeling. I encourage new people to learn this language because it is so easy
to implement and the lack of compiling makes it a one-step debugging process. He understands
why his language is loved by many, although the online writings didn't seem to address many
of Python's problems- being somewhat too higher level, not being universal (2.7 is best Python),
etc.
